# ewangelista.it

So the ewangelista.it is the project from my past role in Microsoft. In 2007 I started the work in Microsoft as Technical Evangelist.

First I was blogging on different name, but after few month I came up with the idea of ewangelista.it domain and brand.

At it stayed with me, even after I changed my role in 2016.

To be continued...
